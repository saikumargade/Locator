   When user logs in to the application, he/she is directed to a map view where user can see his current location
   (if location permissions are granted). If the user has admin privilages, an extra button is rendered which says "Add People"
    which when clicked adds a random person to map with a marker(on clicking it,list of people at that location are displayed)
